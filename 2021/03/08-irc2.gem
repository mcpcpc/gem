# irc2: A Minimal IRC Client Using netcat

I am writing this after having spent the past year developing a "more than functional" C-based IRC client, kirc, and reflecting on my journey up until this point. The ugly truth is that kirc was never the IRC client I *wanted* to develope. Instead, it became the client I *needed* to develope in order to enhance my understanding of the C programming language and RFC1459 protocol. Now, having grown accustomed to working and manipulating the raw IRC data stream, I can finally revisit the question that started me on this journey, which is *what makes an ideal IRC client*?

=> https://github.com/mcpcpc/kirc
=> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459

## Essential Characteristics

To answer this, I would like to start by listing the attributes that I find essential for any CLI-based client:

*   Persistent session management, via automatic keep-alive response (a.k.a. PING<>PONG).
*   Command aliasing, which covers the scope of basic/frequently used commands (e.g. PRIVMSG, JOIN, PART, etc).
*   Ability to pipe/fork and daemonize the application for third-party application development, chat logging, bots or direct TTY manipulation.

Note that this list does not take into account multi-channel support or more advanced features that others might be deemed essential. However, based on this limited list, I think anyone can develop a half-decent client that can be extended to accommodate more advanced features through scripting. If we look at the current Linux tools that ship with a modern OS, there is an arsenal of utilities that we can leverage to create such a tool.  One of particular interest is netcat, which is the "swiss army knife" for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. Furthermore, it easily checks the third attribute listed above. The question becomes, how do we accommodate for the first two attributes in the list?  We create a wrapper shell script, of course!

## Wrapping It Up

I will save you the headaches and research and just share the wrapper script I have created and affectionately named "irc2".

```
#!/bin/sh
#
# Usage: $0 [<server>] [<port>] [<nick>] [<username>] [<realname>]

[ -z “$NCIRC” ] && {
	fd=“/tmp/.irc2”; rm -f “$fd”; mkfifo “$fd”
	nc “${1:-irc.freenode.org}” “${2:-6667}” <“$fd” | \
		NCIRC=1 exec “$0” “$@“ >”$fd”
}

trap ‘kill 0’ EXIT HUP INT
printf ‘NICK %s\r\n’ “${nick:=${3:-$(id -un)}}”
printf ‘USER %s localhost * :%s\r\n’ “${4:-$nick}” “${5:-$nick}”

while IFS= read -r cmd; do
	case $cmd in
		/join*)
			curr=${cmd#* }
			printf ‘%s\r\n’ “${cmd#/}”
		;;
		/*)
			printf ‘%s\r\n’ “${cmd#/}”
		;;
		*)
			printf ‘PRIVMSG %s :%s\r\n’ “$curr” “$cmd”
		;;
	esac
done </dev/tty &

while IFS= read -r line; do
	case $line in
		‘PING ‘*)
			printf ‘PONG %s\r\n’ “${line#* }”
		;;
		*)
			printf ‘%s\n’ “$line” >/dev/tty
		;;
	esac
done
```

In ~39 cloc, we have a script that checks all of the boxes on my list and works on 99% of POSIX-compliant shells.  Nifty, eh?

## Chat History Logging

There are a couple of ways of going about this, but one that I recently discovered is the built-in script command, which is meant for creating transcripts of tty sessions.

```
script -a -c irc2 chat_log.txt
```
